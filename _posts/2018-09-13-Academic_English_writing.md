# Academic Writing Style: Vocabulary
**a. Use appropriate academic words**  
(see <a href="http://www.uefap.com/vocab/select/awl.htm" target="_blank"> Academic Word List</a> or Oxford Advanced Leaner’s Dictionary.)   
其中Academic Word List (AWL) 主要是一个主要单词后面跟一堆衍生词，都是在学术英语中常见的单词，没事可以背一些

**b. Avoid informal language. 避免使用不正式的语言**  
(kind of ==> somewhat, stuff ==> information, 
lots of ==> numerous (a signifcan number of), guys ==> men, etc.)

**c. Avoid phrasal verbs 避免使用动词短语**  
such as keep up, get by, take on. They are usually too informal. Use more formal single verbs (e.g. maintain, survive, recruit).

**d. Use appropriate, descriptive reporting verbs. 采用适当的描写性的转述动词**  
(think ==> assert, mention ==> illustrate)

**e. Include field-specific, technical language. 使用专业术语**




# Academic Writing Style: Grammar
**a. Avoid contractions 避免缩写**  
It’s ==> It is,    can’t ==> cannot, etc.

**b. Use formal negative forms. 使用正式的否定形式**  
not…any ==> no,     not much ==> little   
The analysis didn’t yield any new results. ==> The analysis  yielded no new results

**c. Limit the use of “run on” expressions, such as “and so forth” and “etc.” 减少“等等”的表达**   
 These semiconductors can be used in robots, CD players, etc. ==>  _________________

**d. Place adverbs within the verb phrases.把副词放在动词词组中间**  
 Adverbs are often placed mid-position rather than in the initial or final position.   
 In informal English, adverbs often occur at the beginning or end of sentences.   
Then the solution can be discarded. ==> ______________

**e. Avoid excessive “personal language” 避免使用过多与人有关的，一般多把物体当做主语**   
– addressing the reader as “you” (except if you are writing a textbook). 
This means that there is much use of passive structures or nouns as subjects or objects.  
You can see the results in Table 1. ==> The results can be seen in Table 1. 

# Exercise: Reducing informality

# Academic English Feartures

2. **Formailty**：正式，严谨，避免使用口语化的表达（a lot of, thing, sort of)、缩略语（can't, shouldn't)  
3. **Objectivity**：客观，避免使用 In my opinion. I think, you, 多用事物的被动语态
4. **Precision**：用数据说话

6. **Explicitness**,说到别人想法时要说到出处  
7. **Hedging**
