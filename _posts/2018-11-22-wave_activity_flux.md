Nowadays，I am studying how to calculate the wave activity flux by ncl and the its theory as well as its hypothesis.   

Recommended by classmate，there is <a href="http://www.atmos.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/nishii/programs/index.html" target="_blank">a website introducing the algorithm and procedure</a>.  
The algorithm of this website reference the following two papers：   
> Plumb, R. A. (1985). "On the three-dimensional propagation of stationary waves." Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences 42(3): 217-229.

> Takaya, K. and H. Nakamura (2001). "A formulation of a phase-independent wave-activity flux for stationary and migratory quasigeostrophic eddies on a zonally varying basic flow." Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences 58(6): 608-627.
